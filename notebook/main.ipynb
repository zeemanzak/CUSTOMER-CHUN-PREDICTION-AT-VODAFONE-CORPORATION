    "In a highly competitive market, businesses strive to retain their existing customers while continuously acquiring new ones. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company, poses a significant threat to revenue and growth. Understanding and predicting customer churn can enable businesses to implement proactive measures to improve customer retention, thereby enhancing profitability and long-term customer loyalty.\n",

    "- Accuracy: The model should achieve an overall accuracy of at least 85%. This ensures that the majority of predictions (both churn and non-churn) are correct.\n",
    "- Precision and Recall: The model should maintain a precision and recall of at least 80%. High precision ensures that when the model predicts churn, it is usually correct. High recall ensures that the model identifies most of the actual churn cases.\n",
    "- F1-Score: The F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, should be at least 0.80. This is crucial for ensuring that the model performs well in identifying churners without being biased towards either false positives or false negatives.\n",
    "- AUC-ROC: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) should be at least 0.85. A high AUC-ROC value indicates a good ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners."
